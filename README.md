# Self Driving Car Simulation 

**Simulator Used** - [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)

**CNN Model Used for Training** - [End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixxJmwhK_0AhVIS2wGHWNdCZMQFnoECAIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1604.07316&usg=AOvVaw3oMtbM1FHRhhwQD-n3nlCN)


The project includes the following files:

    model_training.ipynb -> containing the script to create and train the model
    drive.py -> for driving the car in autonomous mode
    model.h5 -> containing a trained convolution neural network

## Tech Stack

**Programming Language** - Python 3

**Libraries** 
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- OpenCV

## Results
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing

    python drive.py model.h5
